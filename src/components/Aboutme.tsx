            After graduating with a Bachelor's in Electrical and Computer Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin, I took quite an unorthodox career path.
            I started my career by opening a business franchise called Schlotzsky's where I learned all the ins and outs of a business.<br />
            After some time, I was encouraged by my sister to pursue teaching which is where I am now. I've been teaching computer science for about 3 years now and am enjoying it very much!
            However, I am looking to move out of teaching to pursue a career in tech; ideally in front-end development. I've been teaching mostly front-end development and have found much joy
            in working on some projects on my own. I am open to other positions as well though since my main goal is to learn and develop my skills.<br />
